    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the National University of
        Computer and Emerging Sciences, Pakistan, which I completed in August 2024. I have a solid background in Java
        and backend development, and I’ve built projects like a social media blog API using layered architecture and
        RESTful principles. I also have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which gives me a good
        balance between front-end and back-end development. Lately, I’ve been sharpening my skills in data structures,
        algorithms, AWS, and system design as I prepare for entry-level software engineering roles.

        Outside of academics and coding, I'm passionate about problem-solving and enjoy challenging myself with new
        technologies. I’ve always had a curiosity for how systems work, which is what drew me to software engineering in
        the first place. I’m also a fast learner—I taught myself React by building small projects from scratch—and I
        thrive in collaborative environments where I can both contribute and grow. On a personal note, I enjoy exploring
        new tools, staying consistent with self-improvement, and I find a lot of motivation in turning ideas into clean,
        functional solutions.</p>
